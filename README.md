Each task was approached carefully, ensuring that the work is organized, professional, and reflects my understanding of digital marketing principles.

### Task 1 – Social Media Calendar

The calendar ensures consistent posting across social media platforms, engages the target audience, and promotes brand awareness. I also included guidance on post timing and content type to maximize audience interaction.

### Task 2 – Content Marketing Strategy
For Task 2, I developed a **comprehensive content marketing plan** including target audience research, blog topics, and recommended promotion channels. I organized the plan in tables and added actionable suggestions to ensure content creation aligns with brand goals and reaches the intended audience effectively.

### Task 3 – SEO Strategy
Task 3 required creating a **detailed SEO strategy**, covering keyword research, technical SEO, on-page and off-page optimization, local SEO, and a 90-day roadmap. I also included a final checklist for easy implementation. This task helped me gain practical experience in enhancing website visibility, attracting organic traffic, and building domain authority.

### Task 4 – Brand Reputation Management
Task 4 focused on developing a strategy to **monitor and manage online brand reputation**. I included methods to handle negative reviews professionally, build positive sentiment, and recommended tools to monitor and respond to customer feedback. This task emphasized the importance of credibility and active brand management online.

All files for each task are included in separate folders and contain **Word documents and PDF versions** for easy viewing. Each file is structured to be clear, actionable, and professional, reflecting my personal understanding and effort. Completing all four tasks has provided me with comprehensive hands-on experience in digital marketing, allowing me to combine strategy, analysis, and practical implementation in one cohesive repository.
